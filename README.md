# My Neovim configuration

My config for Neovim.
Wanted to give Vim a spin to understand why people are so religious about it. (Probably [ThePrimeeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) is primarily at fault here)

And until now I see I kinda like it... 

## Why no prebuilt Config

While I tried NvChad and LazyVim and they are both beautifully made configs with efficient lazy loading.

I liked a config structure that uses the possibility of Lazy.nvim to use one file for every Plugin.

Also, I wanted to get an understanding of the tools I use step by step instead of just getting dropped there without having an understanding of basic things.
